OpenLiveView-WebControl
=======================

*An open implementation of Sony's LiveView protocol.*

This Android application aims to be a complete replacement for the proprietary applications provided by Sony.

This version contains extensions for controlling e.g. your smart home using web-interfaces.


Notice
------
The base of this implementation (figuring out the details of the protocol) was done by [Andrew de Quincey][adq], who posted details of the LiveView protocol on his blog and provided a Python server for use on a computer.
